# CompareLBMD
Compare MDV and LB-Triangulation.
Run CompareMain.py
It requires an input of number of nodes and number of edges in an arbitrary graph.
It will give chordal graphs on same arbitrary graph for two different triangulation 
algorithms namely LB-Triangulation and Minimum Degree Vertex.
These two algorithms are compared on the number of edges added in both of the algorithms
